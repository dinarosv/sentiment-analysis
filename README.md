# Norwegian Sentiment Analysis

Jupyter notebook for sentiment analysis in norwegian. Includes a norwegian dataset with data from [NoReC, Norwegian Review Corpus](https://github.com/ltgoslo/norec) 
and norwegian tweets analyzed by a sentiment lexicon and emojis.   
  
The model is based on Tensorflow's implementation of Keras. We use the Sequential model from Keras with preprocessing such as
tokenization, truncating and padding.  

This notebook is influenced a lot by [Hvass-Labs TensorFlow Tutorials](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/20_Natural_Language_Processing.ipynb).
